NASA APOD 

Description

An application created using NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day API. 

Within the application you can select a month and a year you would like to search. A request is then sent to NASA Api for the selected month and year. Once that data is collected, a collection view will be populated with pictures showing each day of the selected month and year.
You may then choose a picture out of the collection to look into further. 
A new screen will then be shown with the Year, month and date in the title. The selected photo will also be shown with a corresponding message written by NASA marknig the significance of the photograph. 

How it was made

The project was created using UIKIT and Storyboards.

Learning

-UICollecitonView
-UIPickerView
-JSON parsing and working with data 

In this project you get the chance to work with the all important navigation controller and setting up a few basic UI elelments. 
You also get a chance to work with delegates and data sources when setting up and using a collection view.
This project is also a good way to practice basic network calls to an API, without going into Headers or Authentification keys. Then using and implementing the retrived JSON data and parsing that data into usable objects.

Final Thoughts 

This applcation was the perfect amount of challenge and peace. Overall, by building this applicaiton. You get the value of working and creating. You are allowing yourself to create a foundation for futher growth. 
Down the line you may choose to revisit this applcation and build a more extensive User Interface or take a deeper dive into the NASA APOD API. 
Just know that when you do, you were only able to do so, becuase the building blocks you learned today.
